# Create a personal Portfolio

## Create a professional portfolio given the instructions in challenge 2

In this weeks challenge I will build and deploy personal porfolio with no starter code.

- Created the html/CSS code to make navigation and changes easier.
- Added sementic elements.
- Added alt attributes to all image elements.
- Added multiple comment messages to CSS styling.

Learned to meticulously go through source code and made the necessary changes to prevent future issues.
